Sorry for using python for this task, it wasn't mentioned in the list of permitted languages, but otherwise there would've been just [that](https://github.com/koteych/naive-templater/commit/f0110f73161cf562e92eb8e929ca6112be084edc) here.

```
    cd naive-templater/templater

    python3 templater.py ../folder_structures/1
    python3 templater.py ../folder_structures/with_cycles/
```
